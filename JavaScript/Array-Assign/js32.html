<!-- 32. Given two arrays of integers A and B of sizes M and N respectively. Write a Write a c program, which will produce a third array named C. such that the following sequence is followed. 
All even numbers of A from left to right are copied into C from left to right. 
All odd numbers of A from left to right are copied into C from right to left. 
All even numbers of B from left to right are copied into C from left to right. 
All old numbers of B from left to right are copied into C from right to left.
e.g., A is {3, 2, 1, 7, 6, 3} and B is {9, 3, 5, 6, 2, 8, 10} the resultant array C is {2, 6, 6, 2, 8, 10, 5, 3, 9, 3, 7, 1, 3}   -->
